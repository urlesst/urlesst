Welcome to my profile! I'm Urlesst, though my friends call me Kevin. I'm a data science student, a waifu lover, and a math enthusiast. I code in my free time, but I often forget to upload my projects and sometimes lose them on my desktop xD.

- Programming languages I know: **C++, Java, Python, JavaScript (with Node.js), C**
  
- Moving from **Arch Linux** to **Debian** (Arch has broken on me 5 times already ðŸ—¿ cof, cof [dotfiles](https://github.com/urlesst/dotfiles) update for Debian?). 
  
- Character in my pfp: **Carlotta Montelli - Wuthering Waves**.
  
- I respond faster on Discord.

And no, HTML is __NOT__ a programming language. **Cheers!**
